## 🧑‍💻 Public Projects & Repos  
Here are some of my publicly accessible projects:

| Repo / Project Name | Short Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| **`RAG-POC`** | Proof-of-concept for RAG pipelines (embeddings + retrieval + generation) — demo-level. |
| **`FineTuning-MultimodalLM`** | Experimentation with multimodal model fine-tuning and testing. |
| **`NLP-Pipeline`** | Python-based text processing & NLP pipeline scripts / utilities. |
| **`Content-Transformation-Agent`** | Prototype agent for content transformation using LLMs + retrieval. |
| **`Adv_RAG`** | Advanced RAG pipeline project capable of handling large embedding sets. |

> ⚠️ *Note*: These are public prototypes and experiments — meant to showcase my coding style, approach to ML/NLP engineering, and willingness to explore.

## 🚀 What I Do (Industry & Private Work)  
Beyond public repos, I have heavy experience building production-grade systems in corporate and startup settings:  

- Designing and deploying **on-prem LLM inference platforms** with microservices (Docker, RabbitMQ, storage, APIs).  
- Building **enterprise-grade RAG systems** (ingestion, embedding pipelines, hybrid retrieval, metadata filtering, efficient ranking) for large-scale documents.  
- Fine-tuning LLMs (e.g. Qwen / LLaMA variants) using PEFT/SFT; quantization for optimized inference; distributed training on cloud/cluster setups.  
- Implementing **agentic AI workflows** integrating external enterprise data sources (e.g. Salesforce) for contextual querying and automated reporting.  

These experiences are part of my professional/freelance portfolio, which I’m happy to discuss or present privately — they reflect real-world impact even if not fully open-sourced.

## ✨ Quick About Me  
- Passionate about building **end-to-end AI & ML systems** — from data preprocessing and embeddings to inference and deployment.  
- Enjoy solving hard technical problems, especially around retrieval, embedding pipelines, scalability, distributed compute and RAG systems.  
- Always experimenting, always learning — my public repos reflect the “sandbox” where I try out new ideas; my private / industry work reflects the “production” where I deliver at scale.
